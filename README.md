- Vite: The app uses Vite as the build tool, providing fast and efficient development experience with instant server start and hot module replacement (HMR).
- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md): This official Vite plugin enables Fast Refresh using Babel, allowing for quick updates to the UI during development.
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc): This official Vite plugin uses SWC for Fast Refresh, providing an alternative to Babel for faster compilation and better performance.

- Redux: The app utilizes Redux, a predictable state container for JavaScript applications, to manage the application state. You can access the Redux store using the `store` object and perform actions using Redux's `dispatch` function.
- LocalStorage: The app uses the browser's LocalStorage API to persist the state in the user's browser, allowing for data persistence across page reloads. You can access the LocalStorage using the `localStorage` object and use methods like `getItem` and `setItem` to read and write data.
